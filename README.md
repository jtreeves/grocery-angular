## Description

This is a **TypeScript** web app using the **Angular** framework. The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0. It is a part of a series of apps designed to compare various frontend frameworks. Check out the code bases for the [React](https://github.com/jtreeves/grocery-react) and [Vue](https://github.com/jtreeves/grocery-vue) versions of the same app.
